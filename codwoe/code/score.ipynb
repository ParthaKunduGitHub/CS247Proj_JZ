    "### **Purpose of the Code**\n",
    "This code evaluates NLP models using specialized metrics such as **BLEU scores**, **MoverScore**, **cosine similarity**, and **mean squared error (MSE)**. Two primary types of tasks are assessed:\n",
    "1. **Definition Modeling (Defmod)**:\n",
    "   - Involves generating textual definitions (glosses) for words based on embeddings or other input formats.\n",
    "2. **Reverse Dictionary Modeling (Revdict)**:\n",
    "   - Involves predicting embeddings or dense vectors from textual glosses.\n",

    "  - Ensures evaluation accounts for linguistic variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MoverScore (MvSc)**:\n",
    "  - A newer, more advanced metric for evaluating textual outputs by computing word mover distances in a high-dimensional space (leveraging pre-trained embeddings such as DistilBERT).\n",
    "  - Captures semantic meaning more effectively than traditional BLEU scores.\n",
