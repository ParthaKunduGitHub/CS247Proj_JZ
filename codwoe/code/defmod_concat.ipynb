    "The attached code implements a **definition modeling neural architecture** designed for NLP tasks such as generating glosses (definitions) from word embeddings. Below is a detailed explanation of the model and its architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Type of Model**\n",
    "The model is a **sequence-to-sequence transformer-based architecture**, adapted for definition modeling tasks. It leverages **embedding inputs** (like word embeddings) and outputs textual glosses, trained using supervised learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Architecture Overview**\n",
    "1. **Input Features**:\n",
    "   - The model takes **source embeddings** as inputs, with support for multiple embedding architectures such as:\n",
    "     - **SGNS**: Skip-Gram Negative Sampling embeddings.\n",
    "     - **Char**: Character-level embeddings.\n",
    "     - **Electra**: Contextualized embeddings from the Electra model.\n",
    "   - These embeddings are concatenated to form a unified input vector. The dimensionality is dynamically determined by summing the embedding dimensions of the selected architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Layers**:\n",
    "   - **Input Projection Layer**:\n",
    "     - A linear transformation adjusts the concatenated embedding input vector to match the model's internal hidden dimension (`input_dim`).\n",
    "   - **Multi-Head Attention**:\n",
    "     - Attention mechanisms (`n_head`) allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when generating glosses.\n",
    "   - **Transformer Encoder-Decoder**:\n",
    "     - The model has `n_layers` of transformer blocks in both the encoder and decoder.\n",
    "     - The **encoder** processes the input embeddings to create a context-rich representation.\n",
    "     - The **decoder** generates definitions (glosses) word-by-word by attending to the encoder's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loss Functions**:\n",
    "   - **Cross-Entropy Loss**:\n",
    "     - Standard cross-entropy loss is used for training.\n",
    "   - **Label Smoothing Cross-Entropy** (optional):\n",
    "     - A smoothing factor (`label_smoothing`) can be applied to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimization**:\n",
    "   - **AdamW Optimizer**:\n",
    "     - The model uses AdamW with tunable learning rate, weight decay, and beta parameters.\n",
    "   - **Learning Rate Scheduler**:\n",
    "     - Implements a warmup phase (`warmup_len`) and a schedule to gradually decay the learning rate over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Additional Features**\n",
    "1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:\n",
    "   - The code supports hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization via the `skopt` library. Parameters such as learning rate, dropout rate, and architecture depth are optimized.\n",
    "2. **Dataset Handling**:\n",
    "   - The model works with training, validation, and test datasets using custom data loaders. It supports embeddings pre-computed for different architectures and gloss text in tensor format.\n",
    "3. **Logging and Monitoring**:\n",
    "   - Metrics such as loss and accuracy are logged using TensorBoard for detailed analysis.\n",
    "4. **Multiple Embedding Sources**:\n",
    "   - The architecture allows for flexible input by dynamically accommodating embeddings from various architectures (e.g., SGNS, Char, Electra).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Highlights**\n",
    "The model is designed to effectively combine pre-trained embeddings from multiple sources and generate human-readable definitions. Its reliance on **transformer-based mechanisms** ensures it can capture intricate relationships between input embeddings and output glosses. The modularity in the code (e.g., architecture selection, loss functions, and input embeddings) also makes it extensible for various tasks beyond definition modeling.\n",
