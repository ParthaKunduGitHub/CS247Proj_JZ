    "### Detailed Explanation of the Model Architecture in the Attached Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The attached file contains implementations of two primary models: **DefmodModel** and **RevdictModel**, both based on a **Transformer architecture**. These models are designed for tasks such as definition modeling (generating textual glosses from embeddings) and reverse dictionary operations (inferring embeddings from glosses). Below is an in-depth analysis of the architecture and its design choices:\n",

    "### **DefmodModel**: Transformer for Definition Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Purpose**\n",
    "The `DefmodModel` generates textual definitions (glosses) from input embeddings. It is used in definition modeling tasks where the goal is to translate dense vector representations into human-readable explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Components**\n",
    "1. **Input Projection Layer**:\n",
    "   - The model supports multiple concatenated embedding types (e.g., SGNS, Char, Electra). These are projected to the required dimensionality using a linear layer (`input_projection`).\n",
    "   - This layer ensures that the model can handle varying input dimensionalities and unify them into the expected internal feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embedding Layer**:\n",
    "   - Maps output tokens (words) to embeddings of size `d_model`. This is used in both training (when input sequences are provided) and inference (to predict tokens step-by-step).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Positional Encoding**:\n",
    "   - Injects positional information into the embeddings so that the transformer can capture the sequence order.\n",
    "   - Uses sine and cosine functions to generate position-based signals for each token in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Transformer Encoder**:\n",
    "   - Composed of multiple layers (`n_layers`) with:\n",
    "     - Multi-head self-attention: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input when processing a given token.\n",
    "     - Feedforward layers: Apply non-linear transformations to enrich the learned representations.\n",
    "   - This encoder processes the concatenated embeddings and sequences, combining their contextual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Vocabulary Projection Layer**:\n",
    "   - A fully connected layer (`v_proj`) maps the output of the transformer to a distribution over the vocabulary. This is used to predict the next token in the gloss sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Training and Beam Search Prediction**:\n",
    "   - The model supports beam search decoding (`pred`) for generating high-quality glosses during inference.\n",
    "   - A `CrossEntropyLoss` function is used for training, with optional label smoothing to enhance generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Strengths of Architecture**\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Handles multiple embedding sources dynamically, making it adaptable to various upstream embedding models.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Uses modular transformer blocks, allowing easy adjustment of depth (`n_layers`) and complexity (`n_head`).\n",
    "- **Sequence Prediction**: Supports advanced decoding methods like beam search for generating coherent glosses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **RevdictModel**: Transformer for Reverse Dictionary Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Purpose**\n",
    "The `RevdictModel` predicts a dense vector representation from a textual gloss, essentially performing the reverse operation of `DefmodModel`. This is useful for tasks like embedding reconstruction or understanding words based on their definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Components**\n",
    "1. **Embedding Layer**:\n",
    "   - Encodes the input gloss into dense token-level embeddings of size `d_model`. Padding tokens are ignored during computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Positional Encoding**:\n",
    "   - Provides positional information to the gloss embeddings, ensuring that the transformer can process sequential order effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transformer Encoder**:\n",
    "   - Similar to the `DefmodModel`, the encoder consists of multiple transformer layers.\n",
    "   - Processes gloss embeddings and generates contextualized token representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature Aggregation**:\n",
    "   - Combines the token representations using a masking mechanism to ignore padding and sum over valid tokens.\n",
    "   - Applies a ReLU activation followed by a projection layer (`e_proj`) to output the final dense vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Strengths of Architecture**\n",
    "- **Simplified Output**: Outputs a single dense vector representation per gloss, making it efficient for downstream applications.\n",
    "- **Robustness**: Uses masking to handle variable-length sequences and ensure consistent results across diverse inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Auxiliary Modules**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **PositionalEncoding**:\n",
    "   - A reusable module for adding positional information to inputs. It works with any transformer-based model to help encode sequential dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Learning Rate Scheduler**:\n",
    "   - Implements a warm-up and cosine decay schedule, commonly used in transformer training to stabilize and optimize learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Label Smoothing Cross-Entropy**:\n",
    "   - Enhances training by reducing overconfidence in predictions, which helps the model generalize better to unseen data.\n",
